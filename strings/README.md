# Strings (Text Manipulation)
This folder contains exercises and examples on handling and manipulating string in Python. Key topics include:
- Basic string operations (concatenation, repetition)
- Accessing individual characters and slices
- Common string methods
- Formatting strings
- Working with multi - line strings

Each `.py` file demonstrates different operations and techniques for working with text in Python

## Exercises
- **string_basics.py**: Demonstrates basic string operations like concatenation and repetition.

- **String Indexing and Slicing**  
  This exercise, `string_indexing.py`, covers:
  - Accessing individual characters in a string using positive and negative indexing.
  - Extracting substrings using slicing techniques.
  - Slicing with a step to get every nth character.
  - Reversing the string using slicing.
  - Combining slices, such as taking the first 5 and last 3 characters together.

- **Common String Methods**  
  (Placeholder for upcoming exercises on commonly used string methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.find()`, `.replace()`, etc.)

- **String Formatting**  
  (Placeholder for exercises on string formatting using f-strings, `.format()`, and `%` formatting.)

- **Multi-line Strings and Escape Sequences**  
  (Placeholder for exercises on working with multi-line strings and common escape sequences.)
