# Dictionary Exercises

This directory contains practical exercises for learning and mastering Python dictionaries. Dictionaries are mutable data structures that store data in key-value pairs, allowing quick access to data using unique keys.

## Exercises

- **`exercise_1.py`**: Reads a string input from the user and creates a dictionary that counts the occurrences of each character in the string.
  - **Objective**: Practice creating and manipulating dictionaries, as well as iterating through their keys and values.

- **`exercise_2.py`**: Manages a fruit inventory with fixed prices. The program:
  - Asks the user for a fruit name and quantity sold.
  - Calculates the total price based on the stored prices in the dictionary.
  - Includes error handling for invalid fruit names and non-numeric inputs.
  - Allows the user to make multiple queries.

- **`exercise_3.py`**: Implements a phone directory using a dictionary. The program includes:
  - Displaying the phone directory in default and alphabetical orders.
  - Adding new contacts while validating phone numbers (must be 9 digits).
  - Modifying existing contact information.
  - Searching for a contact by name.
  - Deleting specific contacts or clearing the entire directory.
  - An interactive menu for seamless navigation.

## Purpose

These exercises aim to deepen your understanding of dictionaries by exploring:
- Basic operations: creation, updating, and deletion.
- Advanced use cases: handling user input, validation, and menu-based programs.
- Iterating through dictionaries with `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()`.
