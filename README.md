# Python-course-exercises

A structured repository containing exercises, examples, and projects from my Python course. This repository covers fundamental Python concepts and practical coding exercises as I advance through the course.

## Topics Covered

- **[Data Types]**: Exercises and examples on numerical data types, operators, and type conversions in Python.
- **[Strings]**: Exercises and examples on text manipulation, including basic string operations, slicing, and common string methods.
- **[Dictionaries]**: A deep dive into Python dictionaries, exploring basic operations, advanced methods, and practical use cases through exercises.
*(More topics will be added as I progress through the course)*
