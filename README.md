# Python-course-exercises
A structured repository containing exercises, examples and projects from my Python course. This repository covers fundamental Python concepts and practical coding exercises, as I advance through the course

## Topics Covered
- [Data Types]: Exercises and examples on numerical data types, operators, and type conversions in Python.
- [Strings]: Exercises and examples on text manipulation, including basic string operations, slicing and common string methods
*(More topics will be added as I progress through the course)*

## Repository Structure
Each folder represents a specific topic and contains:
1. `README.md` file explaning the topic and exercises.
2. Source code files (`.py`) with exercises or examples for each topic.

## About this course
I'm currently a 2nd-year student in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM). This course helps me depend my Python knowledge, and the exercises in this repository reflect my progress and learning.

**Topics to Come**

- Control structures
- Functions and modules
- Data structures (lists, tuples, Dictionaries)
- File handling
- Object-Oriented Programming in Python

Stay tuned for updates as I continue learning!
