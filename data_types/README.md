# Data Types

This folder contains exercises and examples on using different data types in Python, including:
- Numeric variables (integers and floats)
- Basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and unary operators)
- Type conversions
- Built-in functions for numerical manipulation

Each `.py` file demonstrates different operations and concepts related to data types.

## Files

- `variable_types.py`: Demonstrates defining and printing different types of variables in Python, such as integers, floats, booleans, and strings.
- `basic_operations.py`: Shows basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integer (floor) division, modulus, exponentiation) and unary operators in Python.
