# Data Types

This folder contains exercises and examples on using different data types in Python, including:
- Numeric variables (integers and floats)
- Basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and unary operators)
- Type conversions
- Built-in functions for numerical manipulation
- Boolean operations
- Variable management and best practices

## Files

- `variable_types.py`: Demonstrates defining and printing different types of variables in Python, such as integers, floats, booleans, and strings.
- `basic_operations.py`: Shows basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integer (floor) division, modulus, exponentiation) and unary operators in Python.
- `type_conversions.py`: Explains type conversions between different data types, including converting floats to integers, parsing integers and floats from strings, handling invalid conversions, and converting booleans to integers and strings.
- `numerical_functions.py`: Demonstrates various built-in numerical functions in Python, including absolute value, rounding, power calculations, minimum and maximum values, square root, and floor and ceiling functions.
- `boolean_operations.py`: Covers the basics of Boolean data types in Python, including defining True and False values, understanding values considered "falsy" in Python, comparison and logical operators.
- `variables_in_python.md`: Provides an overview of variables in Python, covering concepts like dynamic typing, variable assignment, deleting variables, multiple assignments, swapping, and best practices for naming and scope.

Each `.py` file demonstrates specific concepts and operations related to data types in Python.
